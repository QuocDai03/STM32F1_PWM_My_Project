# STM32F1_PWM_My_Project
What does my project do?
- Adjusting the level of brightness of LED by using PWM. There are 999 levels. 
- The level is displayed on 3 LED 7-segment: XYZ (000->999) (one for X, one for Y,one for Z).
- Four push buttons are used to change the brightness level:
Three buttons increment the individual digits of the brightness level.
The fourth button sets the Duty Cycle according to the value displayed on the 7-segment displays.



The hardware included in my project:
- Microcontroller STM32F103C8T6
- ST link V2
- 3 Common cathode 7-Segment LED 
- 3 IC 74HC595
- 4 buttons
- Resistors
- 1 Led
