# STM32F1_PWM_My_Project
What does my project do?
- Adjusting the level of brightness of LED by using PWM. There are 999 levels. 
- The level is displayed on 3 LED 7-segment: XYZ (000->999) (one for X, one for Y,one for Z).
- Using 4 buttons to adjust: 
The value of X,Y,Z is changed by each of 3 buttons (one for X, one for Y,one for Z).
The last one convert the value of XYZ into the value of duty cycle of PWM.

The hardware included in my project:
- Microcontroller STM32F103C8T6
- ST link V2
- 3 Led 7-Segment
- 3 IC 74HC595
- 4 buttons
- Resistors
- 1 Led
